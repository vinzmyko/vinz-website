								<p className="pb-5">For the most part trying to create a game on the PS5 with no documentation was very difficult, going in to development with not much experience with coding without a game engine was a strange and new feeling. I had to try and learn something completely new which motivated me to try and learn with the things that were given to us which were the sample projects showing off the difference between the PS4 and PS5 hardware. My tactic to navigate through this was using a mixture of PS4 documentation and it`s sample projects. </p>
									<p className="pb-5">Researching some company in-house files like the .gnf file was very interesting. In essence one a .gnf file is used to load images and there was a lot of misinformation during my researching, leading me to look up a PS4 hobbiest forum page talking about the .gnf file. They recommended a program called Noetis however I wasn`t able to get it working and moved on. With more research I stumbled upon image2gnf which is an executable file from the PS4 SDK, searching for this term I found PS4 SDK information and gave me the current process which now would be to convert a .png to a .dds to a .gnf. After trying different github applications, I eventually gave up and by chance looking at the PS4 documentation it has information that files get converted through code but couldn`t find anything to do with that through searching the entire solution and thus gave up with trying to change the black background to a white background. Just changing a simple image to something else was quite a task and in the end I couldn`t change a PlayStation file to look like something else. Downloading the PS4 SDK tool didn`t reap any rewards and I stopped trying to figure out the .gnf file. </p>
